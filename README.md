# Lung-Cancer-Segmentation

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to enhance lung cancer diagnosis and treatment through automatic tumor segmentation, employing advanced algorithms for precise and efficient detection.

## Background

Lung Cancer, also known as Bronchial Carcinoma, is a prevalent and deadly form of cancer affecting one in 16 individuals worldwide. Accounting for approximately 25% of all cancer-related deaths, it demands improved diagnostic and treatment strategies. Automatic tumor segmentation offers two crucial advantages: reducing the chance of missing tumors during diagnosis and providing essential data on tumor size and volume for staging, assisting medical professionals in devising tailored treatment plans. Utilizing the Medical Segmentation Decathlon dataset, which comprises 64 full-body CT scans with ground truth masks, the project addresses the challenge of imbalanced data, where large CT scan sizes contrast with relatively small tumor regions.
